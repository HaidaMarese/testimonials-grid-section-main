                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I 
                honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h5>

              <p class="quote mt-3 position-relative" style="z-index: 1;">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.I’ve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve 
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

              <p class="quote mt-3">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which 
                I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and 
                present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention

            Highly recommended!</h5>
          <p class="quote mt-3">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I 
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
            I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
             The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no 
             tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of 
             my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
             100% recommend! ”</p>
